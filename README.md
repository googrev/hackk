Local Store Inventory Management System

This project focuses on building an inventory management system using machine learning to predict and alert for inventory needs. The project comprises scripts that create a local inventory database, train a model for predicting inventory needs, and test the model on unseen data.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:

1. ddaattaa.py
   - Responsible for creating a database and generating the initial dataset (local_store_inventory.csv).

2. moddel.py
   - Performs data processing, model creation, training, testing, and saving the model. Upon execution, it automatically generates:
     - logistic_regression_Model.pkl (Saved logistic regression model file).
     - scaler.pkl (Saved scaler used for data normalization).
     - inventory_alerts.csv (Alerts based on model predictions).

3. unseen_data.py
   - Contains data related to unseen inventory scenarios that the model hasn’t encountered during training. When executed, it creates a dataset file named unseen_data.csv.

4. unseen_data_model.py
   - Utilizes the trained model to make predictions on the unseen data generated by unseen_data.py.

PROJECT WORKFLOW:

1. Creating the Initial Dataset:
   - Execute the ddaattaa.py script to create the inventory database and generate the local_store_inventory.csv file.
     Command: python ddaattaa.py

2. Building and Training the Model:
   - Run the moddel.py file to split, train, and test the model. This script also saves the trained logistic regression model and scaler for future use.
     Command: python moddel.py

3. Testing with Unseen Data:
   - Execute unseen_data.py to create the unseen_data.csv file with new data that hasn’t been used during training.
     Command: python unseen_data.py

4. Making Predictions on Unseen Data:
   - Run unseen_data_model.py to test the model on the newly created unseen dataset and make predictions.
     Command: python unseen_data_model.py

GENERATED FILES:

- local_store_inventory.csv: Contains the initial inventory data created by ddaattaa.py.
- logistic_regression_Model.pkl: Contains the saved logistic regression model trained in moddel.py.
- scaler.pkl: The scaler used for normalizing the data during model training.
- inventory_alerts.csv: Contains inventory alerts generated during model testing in moddel.py.
- unseen_data.csv: Contains unseen data generated by unseen_data.py.

REQUIREMENTS:

- Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:
  Command: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

HOW TO RUN:

1. Create the initial inventory dataset:
   Command: python ddaattaa.py

2. Train the model and generate predictions:
   Command: python moddel.py

3. Create unseen data for testing:
   Command: python unseen_data.py

4. Make predictions on unseen data:
   Command: python unseen_data_model.py

CONCLUSION:

This project allows you to automate inventory management by predicting inventory needs based on historical data. It creates alerts to help store managers make informed decisions about restocking.
